Welcome to **Custom Calculator**! This simple, powerful calculator lets you perform basic arithmetic operations with error handling, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's built to handle edge cases like **overflow** and **invalid input**, so you can focus on the math!

---

## üìù **Description**

This C++ command-line program takes arithmetic expressions as input, validates them, and performs the calculations while handling potential issues such as:
- **Overflow errors** (when numbers exceed the allowed range)
- **Invalid input** (malformed expressions, unsupported characters)
- **Division by zero**

---
## **Calculation Logic:**
- **Stage 1:** Handle multiplication (`*`) and division (`/`) operations from left to right. Results replace the operations in the list.
   - Division checks if the divisor is zero to avoid errors.
- **Stage 2:** Handle addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`) operations from left to right.
- The final result is stored and returned.

---

## ‚ö° **Features**

‚ú® **Full Support for Arithmetic Operations:**
- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide in a single expression!

üîí **Safe Computation:**
- Automatically handles overflow situations where numbers exceed the limits.
- Prevents division by zero.

‚öôÔ∏è **Easy-to-use Interface:**
- Just input an arithmetic expression, and the calculator does the rest!

üí° **Real-time Input Validation:**
- Corrects and prompts for invalid inputs to ensure proper formatting.

---

## üåü **Example Usage**
### **Input Parsing:**
- The program accepts a mathematical expression as a string, e.g., `"5 + 10 * 2"`.
- The string can include numbers, operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and spaces.

---

### **Basic Calculation**

```cpp
std::string input = "5 + 10 * 3 - 4 / 2"; 
std::cout << "Input: " << input << std::endl;
double result = input_func(input); 
std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;  // Expected output: 26
```
---

### **Error Handling Examples:**
#### **Division by Zero**{
```cpp
std::string input = "10 / 0"; 
std::cout << "Input: " << input << std::endl;
double result = input_func(input); 
std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;

```
#### **output**
```cpp
Error: Division by zero
```
---

}
#### **Number is too large**{
```cpp 
std::string input = "1e500 * 1"; 
std::cout << "Input: " << input << std::endl;
double result = input_func(input); 
std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
```
#### **output**
```cpp
Error: Number exceeds limits
```
}

---
#### **Invalid Input (Multiple Operators)**{
```cpp
std::string input = "5 + + 10"; 
std::cout << "Input: " << input << std::endl;
double result = input_func(input); 
std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
```
#### **output**
```cpp
Error: 2 operators fault
```
}
